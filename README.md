# Silverado Cinema

*This project was a university submission for a web programming unit from 2015*

I was instructed to produce a PHP cinima booking system with checkout process that supported:

- Multiple screenings

- Multiple seat types

- Multiple seats

I was restricted from using a RDB backend, so all persisted data in this application is serialised to and from a local file stored on the machine hosting the code.

Frameworks were also disallowed, so I produced a basic MVC psudeo-framework to facillitate my end objective.
